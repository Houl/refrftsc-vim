# refrftsc-vim

[Repmo-vim](https://github.com/Houl/repmo-vim) friendly ftplugin scripts.

Starting with the unmodified scripts.

The modified scripts will probably make use of [motpat.vim](https://github.com/Houl/motpat-vim) (it's included) which for example greatly reduces verboseness in the python ftplugin script file (4 lines instead of 24 lines for the mappings).  motpat is __not required__ for repmo, but all the motions defined by motpat make use of the count which is important.
